I officially started my career in tech roughly 5 years ago, building upon humble HTML, CSS, and Photoshop skills I had picked up as a kid just enjoying the internet. Like many people, my initial exposure to web development came from customizing my LiveJournal and MySpace, and making nerdy fan sites on GeoCities and AngelFire. I was hooked, though; programming fits a fascinating niche for me that touches on my main interests: art, language, psychology, organization, technology, and logic. 

It wasn't long before I had picked up enough through research and practice that I moved on from doing websites for fun to providing a web building service for friends and acquaintances who are writers and artists that needed a digital home for their projects. It was then that I realized that I could really do this: that I was good enough and driven enough to learn and experiment to make a real career out of my hobby.

I picked up several web site projects, just building standard static websites with HTML, Bootstrap, and Custom CSS, and used them as the basis for my portfolio, and then began applying. It wasn't long before I was picked up as a Web Designer for a firm, and it felt surreal to really be doing what I did already for fun and doing it fulltime and getting paid for it. I ended up staying with that firm for close to 4 years, and along the way I got a ton of experience, from doing graphic design for hundreds of ads, to designing educational materials for my team and company, and expanding on my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery knowledge and experience by building and contributing to thousands of websites.

It's this melange of interest and experience that continues to drive my hunger, and makes me more eager than ever to delve deeper into Web Development - I want to bridge that gap from Front End to Fullstack. I'm sensitive to what makes great design from both an artistic and user experience perspective, and want to leverage that sensitivity as I move forward with Back End development.
